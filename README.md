# my-oauth-demo

This code makes heavy use of Baeldung's code and I would like to thank him for his demos as they have greatly helped me soldify oauth concepts and implementation. I have combined and tailored work from several demos to produce a working client app, authorization server, and resource server. Two client apps are provided. Code client runs on localhost:8080. Password client runs on localhost:8083. Authorization server runs on localhost:8081. Resource server runs on localhost:8082. To login on password client, use username/password combo admin:password. Code client will accept same credentials but also provides the interface to register your own email/password combo. Continuing work will focus on providing backend and ui support for the code client. MySQL5 server will need to be running for this to work.
